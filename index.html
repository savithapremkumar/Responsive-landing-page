                <h6 class="proximabold black">What’s in the White Paper?</h6>
                <p class="proxima grey">Digital marketing is no longer about clicks or eyeballs. It’s about delivering actual business results. This white paper explains that performance-based marketing isn’t reliant on a single unit of measurement that can easily be gamed. Instead, it’s about how every element of advertising contributes to achieving a clearly defined business result — as well as over laying path to conversion and ease of purchase. </p>
                <p class="proxima grey">The choice before modern marketers is simple: continue chasing ever-lower CPMs into the bottomless pit or shift to an approach based on quality and business results. Pure performance marketing is a choice you can make today. </p>

                <h6 class="proximabold green" id="expand1Section">Quantity over quality <i class="fa fa-caret-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h6>
                <div id="firstSection">
                    <p class="proxima grey">Imagine if the performance of operators at a hypothetical call centre was measured only on the number of calls they made over the course of a day. </p>
                    <p class="proxima grey">Before long they would be making as many calls as possible in a bid to keep superiors satisfied. While the number of calls will invariably increase, the quality of those calls will steadily decrease. As the workers chase ever-higher numbers, the attention that they pay to actually solving client problems will steadily decline as phone calls are rushed. In fact, it wouldn’t be far-fetched to imagine a particularly crafty operator that simply dials numbers and then puts the phone down as soon as someone answers. The numbers will certainly look great, but is this really what the business wants? </p>
                    <p class="proxima green">In digital advertising, we’ve seen something similar happen. The singular obsession with CPMs (cost per thousand views) has led to marketers and operators chase lower and lower costs. </p>
                </div>

                <h6 class="proximabold blue" id="expand2Section">Changing the rules <i class="fa fa-caret-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h6>
                <div id="secondSection">
                    <p class="proxima grey">Acquire Online’s director Chris Schultz believes it’s time for marketers to introduce a few new rules to the game to ensure they’re getting the best bang for their buck.</p>
                    <p class="proxima blue">He proposes a movement away from the CPM approach toward something that measures actual business performance. It’s about shifting the conversation from a single quantitative measure to something that considers the overall impact of an online campaign. </p>
                </div>

                <h6 class="proximabold green" id="expand3Section">Pay as you go <i class="fa fa-caret-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h6>
                <div id="thirdSection">
                    <p class="proxima grey">A point Schultz points out, marketers will only pay for what is delivered. He compares it to law firms who agree to waive their service fee on the condition that they receive a portion of the settlement should they win a case.</p>
                    <p class="proxima green">“You’re only paying on what we’ve delivered,” says Schultz. “There’s a winwin for the client. Even though it might be capped at $3,000 for the month, but if we only deliver 10 at $10 each, then you’re only paying us $100.” </p>
                </div>

                <h6 class="proximabold purple" id="expand4Section">The creative gap <i class="fa fa-caret-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h6>
                <div id="fourthSection">
                    <p class="proxima grey">According to Global Web Index, the leading cause for adblock usage among New Zealanders is because they find online ads annoying or irrelevant.</p>
                    <p class="proxima grey">What this tells us is that there’s a major gap in creativity when it comes to this space. The ads being served at the moment are simply not interesting enough to deserve consumers’ time—and this is largely attributable to the way digital advertising is currently used.</p>
                    <p class="proxima purple">Schultz says “moment marketing with the right message is particularly relevant when it comes re-marketing because consumers have a pretty low tolerance for seeing the same message over and over again.”
